## Who is this guy?

👋I'm a computer engeneer that loves to solve problems and make really bad puns.

👨‍💻*and*...? Oh the back-*end*! I have experience coding with .NET, Unity, SQL and with what i'm currently working with: Node.Js and Typescript
Besides that, AWS has really taken some time out of me so i like to consider myself an infra guy as well. I've dealt with Kubernetes (<3), SES, S3, Cognito, Dynamo, Dax, RDS, Athena and a few others... 

🐶 Training Sky (<- puppy's name) is part of my everyday and so is solving puzzles! Going to the gym to look like someone that is not sitted in a chair all day (:cry:) is also an everyday thing.

🌱 I've been tring to read and study more about personal growth and currently reading "12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos" wich is so simple and yet mind blowing at the same time.
